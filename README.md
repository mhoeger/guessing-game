# Guessing Game
See it in action at https://aka.ms/guessing-game

Back-end: Azure Functions <br>
Front-end: Vue.js single page application

In this project, there are examples of:
- Live-refresh with **SignalR** and Azure Functions
- Writing to **Cosmos DB** using an Azure Function binding
- Using the **Cosmos DB SDK** within an Azure Function
- Likely bad front-end code ðŸ™ƒ

NOTE: This would be a perfect project with [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/), but this demo was made a month or so before that service previewed.
